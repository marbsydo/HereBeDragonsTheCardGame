## Elements

Each card suit represents an element. For each of the four elements, there exists a leviathan, a wyrm, amulets and locations.

| Element | Dragons                     | Amulet       | Location
|:--------|:----------------------------|:-------------|:--------
| Wind    | Wind Leviathan, Wind Wyrm   | Wind Amulet  | Whirlwind
| Ocean   | Ocean Leviathan, Ocean Wyrm | Ocean Amulet | Whirlpool
| Storm   | Storm Leviathan, Storm Wyrm | Storm Amulet | Tempest
| Ghost   | Ghost Leviathan, Ghost Wyrm | Ghost Amulet | Shipwreck

Or put simply:

* Spade is wind;
* Club is ocean;
* Diamond is storm;
* Heart is ghost.

Here is some advice to help remember which suit is which element:

* Spade is pointy, like a weather vane;
* Club is curvy, like the ocean waves;
* Diamond is angular, like lightning;
* Heart keeps you alive, and ghosts aren't.
