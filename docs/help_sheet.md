## Elements

Each card suit represents an element. For each of the four elements, there exists a leviathan, a wyrm, amulets and locations.

| Element | Dragons                                      | Amulet       | Location
|:--------|:---------------------------------------------|:-------------|:--------
| Wind    | Hydra, Wind Leviathan, Wind Wyrm             | Wind Amulet  | Whirlwind
| Ocean   | Kraken, Ocean Leviathan, Ocean Wyrm          | Ocean Amulet | Whirlpool
| Storm   | Cthulhu, Storm Leviathan, Storm Wyrm         | Storm Amulet | Tempest
| Ghost   | Flying Dutchman, Ghost Leviathan, Ghost Wyrm | Ghost Amulet | Shipwreck

Or put simply:

* Spade is wind;
* Club is ocean;
* Diamond is storm;
* Heart is ghost.

Here is some advice to help remember which suit is which element:

* Spade is pointy, like a weather vane;
* Club is curvy, like the ocean waves;
* Diamond is angular, like lightning;
* Heart keeps you alive, and ghosts aren't.
