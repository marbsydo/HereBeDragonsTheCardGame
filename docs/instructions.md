# Instructions

This document contains the general game overview. For more details, try the following documents:

* [Detailed turn overview](detailed_turn_overview.md); covers all the rules in explicit detail.
* [Help sheet](help_sheet.md); includes tables of which cards are which, and how map symbols are drawn.

## Story

It is the golden age of exploration. You are captain of a ship, boldy setting off deep into the unexplored ocean. Few else dare brave these seas, for fear of the fierce dragons that plague the cursed waters! Undeterred, you are driven onward by tales of plentiful treasures and powerful amulets waiting to be claimed by those mad enough to venture where the map reads, "Here be Dragons!"

## Requirements

* 2-4 players;
* 30 minutes to 1 hour of time;
* Pack of playing cards with both jokers (or print and use a custom card set);
* Sheet of paper (ideally at least A4 size);
* Something to draw with;
* One small object per player to represent their ship (e.g. a coin).

## General Overview

The aim is to collect the most **victory points**. Victory points are obtained by selling **loot** to **towns** and **merchant ships**. Loot consists of **amulets** and **treasures**. Treasures are picked up at **treasure islands**, while amulets are sometimes found by discovering locations.

Locations are discovered by sailing your ship into unexplored squares. When a location is discovered, the map must be updated to show that square has been explored by drawing the corresponding map symbol. Occasionally a **dragon** will be discovered. The dragon troubles whichever ship discovered it. A ship being troubled by a dragon cannot sell loot to towns or merchant ships.

Most loot can be used to perform an action. For example, amulets can **fell** certain types of dragons. While a ship has more than 3 loot it cannot move, and must dispose of the excess loot before its turn ends.

The game ends when the whole map has been explored.

## Setup

1. Draw one large grid - this will be your map. It should be 8x8 squares for 2 players, or 9x9 squares for 3 or 4 players.
2. Each player must choose a ship name.
3. Write each ship's name somewhere beneath the map, leaving room to keep a tally of victory points.
4. Take all the **treasures** out of the pack of cards. (These are the Jacks, Queens and Kings). Place these cards in a pile face down beside the map. This is the **treasures pile**.
5. Take all the remaining cards (including both jokers) and shuffle them. Place the pile face down beside the map. This is the **discovery pile**.
6. Leave space for a **discarded treasures pile** and a **discarded discovery pile**.
7. Draw a **town** in each corner of the map.
8. Each player chooses a corner to start in, and places their ship there. Players can start on the same corner.
9. Players keep **loot** cards hidden in their hand, and place **troubles** face up in front of them. (Dragons are troubles).
10. Each player then takes their turn until the game ends.

## Concise Turn Overview

A player can move their ship once and perform multiple actions, all in any order.

### Movement

* A ship can move one square in any direction: horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
* If the ship lands on an unexplored square, take a card from the **discovery pile**. Update the map by drawing the symbol for the discovered location. (The symbol is on the top right hand corner of the card, if using the custom card set. Otherwise, refer to the **help sheet**).
    * If the card is a **dragon**, place it in your **troubles**.
        * If any dragons already exist in your troubles, all the dragons **fell** each other.
    * If the card is a **location**, place it in the **discovery discard pile**.

### Actions

* Loot can be discarded (i.e. thrown overboard).
    * Discarded **loot** go in the **treasures discard pile**.
* If the ship is on a **town** or a **merchant ship**, **loot** can be deposited in exchange for **victory points** (providing the ship is not troubled by a dragon).
    * The value of loot varies. (The quantity of victory points is written on the card, if using the custom card set. Otherwise, refer to the **help sheet**).
    * Keep a tally of each player's victory points beneath their ship name.
    * Deposited loot goes back in the relevant discard pile.
    * **Merchant ships** must keep a tally in their square of how much loot has been sold to them. No more than 5 loot in total can be sold to a merchant ship.
* If the ship is on a **treasure island**, **treasure** can be obtained.
    * A maximum of 3 treasure per island, per turn, can be taken.
    * An island is depleted after 5 treasure has been taken in total (regardless of who took it).
    * Keep a tally in the square of how much treasure has been taken.
* At the end of their turn, players must ensure they do not have more than 3 **loot** by throwing excess loot overboard (into the relevant discard pile).

### Refilling Card Piles

* If the **discovery pile** becomes empty at any time, shuffle the **discovery discard pile** and replenish it.
* If the **treasures pile** becomes empty at any time, shuffle the **treasures discard pile** and replenish it.
