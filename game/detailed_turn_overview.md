# Here be Dragons: The Card Game

* * *

# Detailed Turn Overview

On their turn, a player can perform one movement and multiple actions. The order does not matter. Additional movement can be achieved through the use of certain actions.

At the very end of their turn, the player must ensure they do not have more than 3 **loot**. Excess loot must be discarded into the **treasures discard pile**.

## Movement

A ship can move either horizontally, vertically or diagonally into an adjacent square.

Ships cannot sail off the edge of the map. Ships can sail on every single square in the map, even squares with other players on. A ship being troubled by a dragon can move onto a town, though it cannot sell loot to that town.

If the ship moves into an unexplored square, pick up a card from the **discovery pile**, and write the corresponding symbol onto the map square. Once a square has a symbol, it is considered to be an **explored square**.

## Discovery

A card taken from the **discovery pile** will be either a location or dragon:

* Location
    * Open Ocean
    * Treasure Island
    * Whirlwind
    * Whirlpool
    * Storm
    * Shipwreck
* Dragon
    * Wind Leviathan
    * Wind Wyrm
    * Ocean Leviathan
    * Ocean Wyrm
    * Storm Leviathan
    * Storm Wyrm
    * Ghost Leviathan
    * Ghost Wyrm

If it is a **location** card, draw the corresponding location on the map, then place the card in the **discovery discard pile**.

If it is a **dragon**, place the card in your **troubles**. Troubles are placed face up in front of you, so that everyone can see. If more than one dragon now exists in your troubles, they all **fell** each other. Felled dragons go in the **discovery discard pile**.

For example, if a ship is being troubled by two dragons, and then discovers a dragon, all three dragons are placed in the discovery discard pile.

## Action

There are several potential actions, depending upon your ship's position, loot, and the positions of other ships:

* Loot a **treasure island**;
* Deposit **loot** at a **town**;
* Use an **amulet** action;
* Use a **treasure** action.

Amulets and treasures must be discarded after one of their actions is performed. They can only perform one action.

### Looting

If your ship is on a **treasure island** square, you can loot it. Treasure is taken from the **treasure pile**. A ship can take up to 3 treasure per island, per turn, regardless of how much loot the ship already holds.

The catch is that a ship cannot have more than 3 loot at the end of its turn. Excess loot must be thrown overboard, and placed in the relevant discard pile.

Keep a tally in the treasure island square of how much treasure has been looted. Once the tally reaches 5, the treasure island has been depleted, and can not be looted any more.

### Depositing

If your ship is on a **town** square, you can deposit **loot** to gain **victory points**, proving your ship is not being troubled by a dragon. Ships being troubled by a dragon can stop on a town square, but cannot deposit loot at a town. Each type of loot has its own value.

Upon depositing a piece of loot, it must be discarded.

You can deposit as little or as much of your loot as you wish.

### Amulet Actions

Each amulet can perform the following actions:

* Steal;
* Fell;
* Sell;
* Special action.

After an amulet's action is used, that amulet must be discarded into the **discovery discard pile**. Amulet actions require specific circumstances, which are elaborated below.

### Amulet - Stealing

When stealing from another player, you take all of their loot.

A **dragon amulet** can steal from any ship being troubled by at least one dragon, regardless of where that ship is.

Other amulets can only steal under the following conditions:

* A **wind amulet** can steal from any ship _near_ a **whirlwind**.
* An **ocean amulet** can steal from any ship _near_ a **whirlpool**.
* A **storm amulet** can steal from any ship _near_ a **storm**.
* A **ghost amulet** can steal from any ship _near_ a **shipwreck**.

A ship is considered to be _near_ a location if it is on top of the location, or within 1 square directly North, South, East, West, or diagonally!

### Amulet - Felling

Any amulet can be used to **fell** a dragon of the same element. A felled dragon is removed from your **troubles** and placed in the **discovery discard pile**.

* A **wind amulet** can fell a **wind wyrm** or a **wind leviathan**.
* An **ocean amulet** can fell an **ocean wyrm** or an **ocean leviathan**.
* A **storm amulet** can fell a **storm wyrm** or a **storm leviathan**.
* A **ghost amulet** can fell a **ghost wyrm** or a **ghost leviathan**.

### Amulet - Sell

Amulets can be used to sell loot when a ship is not on a town. Instead, the ship must be on a square whose element matches that of your amulet. When selling this way, no victory points are gained from the amulet used to perform the sell action.

* A **wind amulet** can sell when your ship is on a **whirlwind**.
* An **ocean amulet** can sell when your ship is on a **whirlpool**.
* A **storm amulet** can sell when your ship is on a **storm**.
* A **ghost amulet** can sell when your ship is on a **shipwreck**.
* A **dragon amulet** can sell when your ship is on any square!

### Amulet - Special Action

Amulets each have their own special action.

#### Dragon Amulet

The **dragon amulet** can be used to move a troubling dragon. One troubling dragon can be moved from any one ship, to any other ship. The dragon amulet is then discarded, and placed in the **discovery discard pile**.

If a dragon is moved to a ship already trouble by a dragon, they do _not_ fell each other. Instead, that ship is now trouble by both dragons. In this way, a ship can be troubled by more than one dragon at a time.

Neither ship has to be in a specific location for the dragon amulet's special action to be used.

#### Wind Amulet

The **wind amulet**'s special action can only be used when the ship holding the amulet is _directly_ on top of a **whirlwind**.

The special action allows the ship to jump to any other square on the board, even if it is unexplored.

#### Ocean Amulet

The **ocean amulet**'s special action can only be used when the ship holding the amulet is _directly_ on top of a **whirlpool**.

The special action allows the ship to move any ship (including itself) to any **whirlpool**.

#### Storm Amulet

The **storm amulet**'s special action can only be used when the ship holding the amulet is _directly_ on top of a **storm**.

The special action allows the ship to discover any **location** in any **unexplored square** on the map.

For example, you can discover a **treasure island**. You _cannot_ discover amulets or dragons.

#### Ghost Amulet

The **ghost amulet**'s special action can only be used when the ship holding the amulet is _directly_ on top of a **shipwreck**.

The special action allows the ship to loot any **treasure island** for up to 5 loot, including any treasure island that you have already looted during your turn.
